# Animated_dataviz_american_debt

The project consist of the creation of datavizualisation with the library plotly in python.
I choose to use the data from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (https://www.newyorkfed.org/data-and-statistics) on credit card debt.

The objectives were to develop my skill to make animated subplots with plotly and render three charts to inform on credit card debt over the year since 2003.

The first chart is an animated cloropleth map of American States representing the average credit card debt per capita.
The second chart is a line and bar chart of the credit debt balance.
The last chart is a line and bar chart of the credit card delinquency.
